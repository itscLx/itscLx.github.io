            <p>We want to find out if the use of do-it-yourself artificial pancreas systems (DIYAPS; open source loop systems) has an influence on the health and well-being of people with diabetes. Additionally, we want to examine the challenges associated with building DIYAPS, and why some people choose not to use DIYAPS.</p>

            <div id="anonymity" style="display: none;">
                <p>We care about your privacy and want you to participate <strong>anonymously</strong>. When you have read the information sheet and decided to take part in our survey, you will first be given a participant ID which guarantees your anonymity in the survey.</p>
                <p>In case you decide to also join Open Humans and link your account to us, we can contact you anonymously without accessing any of your personal information on Open Humans. Please remember not to use any personal information (name/surname) while creating the Open Humans username profile. Use a pseudonym instead!</p>
                <p>If you have uploaded or decide to now upload your device data (instructions on this are provided within the survey) to Open Humans and think this is a good opportunity to share it or some of it from there with us, we will protect your data.</p>

                <p>We are very sorry, but your child is too young to be able to take part in this survey. The available questionnaires are only for parents of children 2 years old and above, as children below a certain age cannot communicate effectively enough to provide proper responses. However, we appreciate your interest and hope you’ll contribute to OPEN in the future!</p>

            <div id="prepare" style="display: none;">
                <p>We will be asking questions about your experience with diabetes — either as a person with diabetes (PwD) or parent/caregiver or partner — so it is best to have any relevant medical documents with you before beginning the survey (e.g. HbA1c values, dates of diagnosis and beginning of insulin pump / CGM therapy / DIYAPS etc.) and the DIYAPS app if you are using one.</p>

                <p>In some of the questionnaires you have to provide an answer to every question, but you can choose “I don’t know” or “I’d rather not say”. In most questionnaires, you can skip questions if you do not want to answer them. However, the more complete your answers are the more you are helping us with our research. </p>

                    <li>If you are interested in helping us <strong>take our research to the next level</strong> by combining your answers from the survey questionnaires with your health-related data, you can also “fill” your account on Open Humans with your CGM data and provide us access (see How-to below).</li>

                <p>The protection of your identity and data is very important to us. Our study is under the General Data Protection Guidelines (GDPR) mandated by the EU, ensuring maximum protection and personal control for participants over their information. As such, in order to keep you anonymous we do not ask for your real name, but generate a <strong>Participant ID</strong> after you have given your consent to participate in our survey.</p>
                <p>We ask you to write down, take a picture or email your Participant ID to yourself and keep it safe. You <strong>will</strong> need it later.</p>
